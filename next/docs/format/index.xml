Format Versioning # Versions 1 and 2 of the Iceberg spec are complete and adopted by the community.
The format version number is incremented when new features are added that will break forward-compatibility&amp;mdash;that is, when older readers would not read newer table features correctly.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://samredai.github.io/iceberg-docs-prototype/next/terms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samredai.github.io/iceberg-docs-prototype/next/terms/</guid><description>Terms # Snapshot # A snapshot is the state of a table at some time.
Each snapshot lists all of the data files that make up the table&amp;rsquo;s contents at the time of the snapshot. Data files are stored across multiple manifest files, and the manifests for a snapshot are listed in a single manifest list file.
Manifest list # A manifest list is a metadata file that lists the manifests that make up a table snapshot.</description></item></channel></rss>
